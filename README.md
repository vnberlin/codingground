Here I will attempt to provide solutions for typical Data Structures and Algorithm problems that may be of use and helpful for someone new to programming. I will do so in a manner that I believe is going to be most relevant justification for the need to learning some of this stuff. I will achieve this by solving typical Data Structures and Algorithms Interview Questions.

The Languages I will use are mainly:
   - C/C++
   - Python 
   - Java (maybe/sometimes)
